Description
-----------
`Problem`
-----------
Customers need to be informed about new features available for them.
System should send automatic emails to customers, it should allow to send event
information (like New Year congratulations and invitations) as well.

`Goal`
------
Create View  for list of customers for sending emails.
Create customizable template for each event, store it in the PostgreSQL database.
Send emails by filling out the necessary variables:
  sender email - send@google.com
  sender email SMTP server, SMTP port. Default settings for google.com are done,

`Solution`
-----------
Design necessary Database structure for keeping the clients and email templates.

View `customer`
-----------------
Create View in the PostgreSQL database for customers with the following structure

+-----------------------------------------------------+
| id_addr | first_name  |     email    |  email_work  |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| integer | varchar(45) | varchar(355) | varchar(355) |
+-----------------------------------------------------+

- **id_addr** client unique id
- **first_name** first name of the client
- **email** personal client's email
- **email_work** client's work email

columns could be named differently - in this case correct the program by putting
your column names instead of those mentioned above accordingly.

Table `email_template`
------------------------
Create table `email_template` in the PostgreSQL database for email templates with the
following structure

+--------------------------------------------+
|   id    | templ |   subject    | signature |
|--------------------------------------------|
| integer | text  | varchar(255) |   text    |
+--------------------------------------------+

- **id** email template unique id
- **templ** html email template
- **subject** subject line for emails
- **signature** signature to put in the email

- - Sample template (column 'templ')
-------------------------------------
- - <html>
- -    <head></head>
- -    <body>
- -        <p>
- - Dear ${PERSON_NAME},<br>
- - <br>
- - It is New Year time!<br>
- - Have a fun and unforgettable moments<br>
- - with your family and friends.<br><br>
- - Happy New Year!!!<br><br>
- - <img src="cid:image_filename"><br>
- - ${SIGNATURE}<br>
- -         </p>
- -     </body>
- - </html>

- - Sample subject (column 'subject')
--------------------------------------
- - Happy New Year!!!

- - Sample signature (column 'signature')
-----------------------------------------
- - ***<br>
- - Sincerely,<br>
- - Test sender<br>
- - Contacts<br>

- Program module
-----------------
Set up database connection credentials.
Set up your email connection credentials
Get template and default elements like subject, signature from PostgreSQL database
Get list of name, email for sending email from PostgreSQL database
Construct personalized email for everybody on the list
Send personalized email using gmail.com service
  For testing purposes use test=True variable with Email class to send email to yourself

  For class' description and more details please see documentation

Getting Started
---------------
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment part for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Linux - Ubuntu
- GitHub
- Python v 3.x
- pip (package manager)
- Virtual environment package 'venv' to distinguish the project from other ones
- PostgreSQL (v12.1 preferably)
- PgAdmin 4
- Gmail account (default) or other email account and necessary information to set up it
- Terminal

Installing
----------
Feel free to skip the step if you already have the tool installed

- Install and Run GitHub
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install git
  ```

  sudo apt-get install python3-venv
  ```
- Create virtual environment for project and activate it
********************************************************
  ```
  python -m venv ./venv/project-folder
  source bin/activate
  ```
  as the virtual environment is activated you'll see the name of your environment
  first in the commmand prompt like where 'send_email' is the name of the virtual
  environment
